## Logfly-webpack

This programme is a study to bring Logfly into compliance with the latest Electron standards:

* only load secure content
* disable the Node.js integration in all renderers that display remote content
* enable context isolation in all renderers

**This is not a functional program**, just a test.

## Structure Project

A Single Page Application developed with web components without any framework.

The project architecture was designed using [ElectronForge](https://www.electronforge.io/) and the [webpack plugin](https://www.electronforge.io/config/plugins/webpack)
